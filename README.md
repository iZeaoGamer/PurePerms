UPDATED: I have fixed the client-crash upon join bug for 1.1 for: GenisysPro, and for Tesseract as well. All you need to do, is download a new file which is PureChat-1.4.0-INDEV in the releases tab, and you should be all good.
Why this occured?:
GenisysPro, and Tesseract have been updated to 1.1.0, and bumped their API to 3.0.1. This plugin did not support 3.0.1 at the time, so there's a fix for this.
for those who are still having this issue, please download this source.
Thank you.
If you have any issues, please be sure to open an issue and we will try coming back to you ASAP.
